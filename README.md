## Development Installation

Begin by cloning and entering into directory.

`git clone https://github.com/vivjamba/goals-for-gordon/`
`cd goals-for-gordon`

To make sure you can connect to the database, you need a .env file containing the MONGODB_URL in the server root directory (goals-for-gordon/server). This file does not get committed.

### Running with Docker
Ensure you download and run Docker daemon. 
```
cd server
npm install nodemon
cd ..
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build the entire environment for development (frontend + backend)
*Note: The `--build` tag atm is only require for when you create new files,
install new dependencies, or alter any Docker related files. Working on making
this a less frequent requirement;

### Running native

To run native, you must use multiple terminal windows or a terminal multiplexer such as tmux.

#### Server

##### Installation
```cd server
cd server
npm install
npm install nodemon
``````
