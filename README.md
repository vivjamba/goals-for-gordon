# Setup

## Step 1: 

Begin by cloning and entering into the root directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/vivjamba/goals-for-gordon/
cd goals-for-gordon
```


## Step 2: 

To make sure you can connect to the database, you need a .env file containing the MONGODB_URL. This file does not get committed. To get this file, click the link below and move the .env file in the server root directory at 
`goals-for-gordon/server` as shown in [file structure diagram](#file-structure).

<br>

## Step 3:


Follow either [Running with Docker](#running-with-docker) or [Running Native](#running-native) steps below to install and run the client and server

<br>

## Step 4:


To access the full build, enter the client address into a web browser. 

Client address `localhost:5173`

The server can also be interacted with separately by sending [requests](#rest-api) to the server address


Server address `localhost:5000`

<br>

# Running with Docker
Ensure you download and run Docker daemon. 
```
cd server
npm install nodemon
cd ..
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build the entire environment for development (frontend + backend)


<br>

# Running Native

To run native, you must use multiple terminal windows or a terminal multiplexer such as tmux.

## Server

In one terminal window, run the following commands:

### Install
```
cd server
npm install
npm install nodemon
```
### Run
```
npm run dev-up
```

## Client

In a seperate terminal window, run the following commands:

### Install
```
cd client
npm install
```

### Run

```
npm run dev
```
