# Setup

## Step 1: 

<br>

Begin by cloning and entering into directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/vivjamba/goals-for-gordon/
cd goals-for-gordon
```
## Step 2: 

<br>

To make sure you can connect to the database, you need a .env file containing the MONGODB_URL. This file does not get committed. To get this file, click the link below and move the .env file in the server root directory at 
`goals-for-gordon/server` as shown in file structure diagram

## Step 3:

<br>

Follow either "Running with Docker" or "Running Native" steps below to run the client and server

## Step 4:

<br>

To access the full build, enter the client address into a web browser. The server can also be interacted with by sending requests to the server address

<br>

Client address `localhost:5173`

Server address `localhost:5000`

<br>

# Running with Docker
Ensure you download and run Docker daemon. 
```
cd server
npm install nodemon
cd ..
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build the entire environment for development (frontend + backend)


<br>

# Running Native

To run native, you must use multiple terminal windows or a terminal multiplexer such as tmux.

## Server

### Install
```
cd server
npm install
npm install nodemon
```
### Run
```
npm run dev-up
```

## Client

### Install
```
cd client
npm install
```

### Run

```
npm run dev
```
